# Build A Trivia Card

- We want the user to be able to read the clue, view an optional hint, and select their answer.

- Effects: A hint box will slide up and down. When you click an incorrect answer, it will fade away and a frowny face will appear. When you click the correct answer, the frowny face will disappear and a smiley face will take its place.

- To complete this project, you must know how to target HTML elements in jQuery, how to create event handlers, and how to use several jQuery Effects methods.
