# Gameboard

- Gameboard is creating a scoreboard that displays NBA scores from around the league. 
- In the `<div class="row more">`, there are two elements: an `<a class="more-btn">` and a `<ul class="more-menu">`. When the `<a>` is clicked, we want the `<ul class="more-menu">` to appear.

- Inside the `<ul class="more-menu">`, there are two elements: an `<li class="share">` and a `<li class="share-menu">`. When the `<li class="share">` is clicked, we want the `<li class="share-menu">` to appear.

- There is a `<span class="notification">` element. When that element is clicked, we want the notification bell to turn yellow.
